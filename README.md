# My Dotfiles

Just keep my dotfiles and notes in one place. Powered by [anishathalye's dotfiles](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles) and [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

I use `master` branch for generic setting. For machine-specific configuration, is located in different branch.
